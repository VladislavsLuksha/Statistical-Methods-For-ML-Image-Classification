# Statistical-Methods-For-ML-Image-Classification

In this project, our goal was to classify images of cats and dogs with help of various types of Neural Networks. In order to preprocess the images, we downscale them to 100x100 or 150x150 pixels depending on the implemented model as well as normalized the data by dividing the pixel values by 255. The models under study are a simple convolutional neural network (Ð¡NN) as well as visual geometry group (VGG). We consider two variations of each model, for color and grayscale images. We selected the best color model based on its binary accuracy and binary cross-entropy, and then fine-tune its hyperparameters. The final model is validated using 5-fold cross-validation and evaluated on a testing set. Our experiments have shown that both VGG models used in the project achieved good results. Nevertheless, we chose to cross-validate the model with color input data because we believe that color information can increase classification accuracy on third-party data. The evaluation of our final model on test set showed the binary accuracy of 0.90 and binary cross-entropy of 0.33.
